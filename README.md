# The Semaphore
This github project is seperated into 4 different folders.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Website contains the website itself.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Server contains the competition server that the site uses for multiplayer networking.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Puzzles contains the puzzle generators that are used within this project as well as some sampe puzzle materials with answers.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Tools contains tools that I have made for my own personal use in maintaining the website.

The theme that was used for this website is from https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/, content in the assets folder under Semaphore_Website is NOT mine. However, I have been responsible for the main layout of the website itself. The assets folder simply determines the theme/graphics of the website.

I have used many different packages written by other members of the community such as socket.io and mysql, the code for these can be found in the node_modules folder under Semaphore_Server. The code in the node_modules server is NOT mine.

All other code however is of my property unless stated otherwise in comments.
