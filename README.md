# The Semaphore
This github project is seperated into 4 different folders.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Website contains the website itself.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Server contains the competition server that the site uses for multiplayer networking.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Puzzles contains the puzzle generators that are used within this project as well as some sampe puzzle materials with answers.
The folder labelled Semaphore_Tools contains tools that I have made for my own personal use in maintaining the website.
